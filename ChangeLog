	check whether a train has brought cargo back to the station
	that it came from.
27-Jun-2003 23:25:54 Luke

15-Jun_2003 23:17:00 Luke
	o Fixed a load of problems with station building.
	-stations can now only be built on the track
	-building a station on a station now upgrades the
	station rather than adding a new one.
	-building stations is now fully undoable in the same
	way as building track.		
15-Jun_2003 20:55:00 Luke
	o The map gets centered on the curors when you press 'C';
	o Pressing 'I' over a station brings up the station info dialogue
	box.
	o Station radii are defined in track xml.

	currently this is triggered by the 'Add cargo to stations' item
	on the game menu.
19-May-2003 04:02:00 Scott
	o Fixed the problem and deviation from the design ;-) of the station
	cargo calculations, there's now a temporary menu item on the display menu.
	Use this to manually update the cargo supply rates.
18-May-2003 20:16:40 Luke
	o Uses the new engine and wagon images on the
	select wagon, select engine, and train info dialogue boxes. 
18-May-2003 00:52:00 Scott
	o The cargo supplied to a station can now be viewed from the menu,
	although some more work is needed.
16-May-2003 22:51:07 Luke
	o Now loads tile sized track images instead of grabbing
	them from the big image.
12-May-2003 00:16:25 Luke
	o Now prints out the time it takes to startup.
11-May-2003 20:24:44 Luke

	o Split up track and terrain images.
28-Apr-2003 22:18:03 Luke

12-Jan-2003 05:11:47 Luke
	o Major refactoring
	o added ant target, checkdep, to check that the dependencies
	betweem packages are in order.  What it does is copy the java files from 
	a package together with the java files from all the packages that it
	is allowed to depend on to a temporary directory.  It then compiles the 
	java files from the package in question in the temporary director.  If the
	build succeeds, then the package dependencies are ok.

	o Refactoring and removing dead code.
10-Jan-2003 23:52:01 Luke

	run jfreerails.
01-Dec-2002 15:53:02 Luke Lindsay
	o Prepare for release.
01-Dec-2002 00:02:25 Luke Lindsay
	o The trains no longer all move at the same speed.
30-Nov-2002 23:00:36 Luke Lindsay
	o Load, save, and new game now work again.
30-Nov-2002 20:45:18 Luke Lindsay
	o The path finder now controls train movement.  Press
	t with the cursor over the track and all the trains will
	head for that point on the track.
27-Nov-2002 23:45:40 Luke Lindsay
	o Wrote SimpleAStarPathFinder and a unit test for it.
	It seems to work.  The next step is use it together with 
	NewFlatTrackExplorer to control train movement.
26-Nov-2002 21:32:20 Luke Lindsay
	o More or less finished NewFlatTrackExplorer and 
	incorporated it into the main game code.
26-Nov-2002 00:17:15 Luke Lindsay
	o Wrote NewFlatTrackExplorer and NewFlatTrackExplorerTest, 
	in preparation for writing a pathfinder.
24-Nov-2002 23:19:10 Luke Lindsay
	o Rewrote PositionOnTrack and added PositionOnTrackTest.
	track positions can now be store as a single int.
24-Nov-2002 00:04:54 Luke Lindsay
	o Organise imports.	
09-Nov-2002 01:13:47 Luke Lindsay 
   o Changes to how the mainmap's buffer gets refreshed.
   Instead of the refresh being driven by the cursor moving,
   it is now driven by moves being received.  This means that 
   it it will refresh even if the moves are generate by another 
   player.
08-Nov-2002 23:05:39 Luke Lindsay 
   o Stations can be built by pressing F8.
   o The station types no longer appear with the track
   types on the build menu.
06-Nov-2002 20:24:10 Luke Lindsay 
   oFixed 'jar_doc' task in build.xml
05-Nov-2002 22:53:11 Luke Lindsay 
   o Moving trains: the class ServerGameEngine
   has a list of TrainMover objects, which control the 
   movement of individual trains.  Movement is triggered
   by calls to ServerGameEngine.update() in the GameLoop's
   run() method.   
03-Nov-2002 22:35:52 Luke Lindsay 
   o Improvements to TrainPosition and ChangeTrainPositionMove classes

   o Removed cyclic dependencies from the rest of
   the project.
16-Oct-2002 21:48:24 Luke Lindsay 
   o Refactored the jfreerails.world.* packages
   	so that (1) jfreerails.world.* do not depend on any
   				other jfreerails packages.
   			(2) there are no cyclic dependencies between
   				any of the jfreerails.world.* packages.
   	hopefully this should make it easier to maintain.
13-Oct-2002 22:30:30 Luke Lindsay 
   o Added trains!  They don't move yet.  Hit F7 when the cursor 
   is over the track to build one.

    o wrote SimplePathIteratorImpl and SimplePathIteratorImplTest
    o removed the method: 
    boolean canStepForward(int distance) 
    from the interface PathWalker so that looking ahead is not required.
16-Sep-2002 21:37:46 Luke Lindsay <lindsal49@hotmail.com>:
	o build.xml written by JonLS added.  (Sorry, I 
	forgot to add it to the change log earlier.)
