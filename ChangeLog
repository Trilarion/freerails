	you no longer need fastUtils.jar on the classpath to compile and
	run jfreerails.
01-Dec-2002 15:53:02 Luke Lindsay
	o Prepare for release.
01-Dec-2002 00:02:25 Luke Lindsay
	o The trains no longer all move at the same speed.
30-Nov-2002 23:00:36 Luke Lindsay
	o Load, save, and new game now work again.
30-Nov-2002 20:45:18 Luke Lindsay
	o The path finder now controls train movement.  Press
	t with the cursor over the track and all the trains will
	head for that point on the track.
27-Nov-2002 23:45:40 Luke Lindsay
	o Wrote SimpleAStarPathFinder and a unit test for it.
	It seems to work.  The next step is use it together with 
	NewFlatTrackExplorer to control train movement.
26-Nov-2002 21:32:20 Luke Lindsay
	o More or less finished NewFlatTrackExplorer and 
	incorporated it into the main game code.
26-Nov-2002 00:17:15 Luke Lindsay
	o Wrote NewFlatTrackExplorer and NewFlatTrackExplorerTest, 
	in preparation for writing a pathfinder.
24-Nov-2002 23:19:10 Luke Lindsay
	o Rewrote PositionOnTrack and added PositionOnTrackTest.
	track positions can now be store as a single int.
24-Nov-2002 00:04:54 Luke Lindsay
	o Organise imports.	
09-Nov-2002 01:13:47 Luke Lindsay 
   o Changes to how the mainmap's buffer gets refreshed.
   Instead of the refresh being driven by the cursor moving,
   it is now driven by moves being received.  This means that 
   it it will refresh even if the moves are generate by another 
   player.
08-Nov-2002 23:05:39 Luke Lindsay 
   o Stations can be built by pressing F8.
   o The station types no longer appear with the track
   types on the build menu.
06-Nov-2002 20:24:10 Luke Lindsay 
   oFixed 'jar_doc' task in build.xml
05-Nov-2002 22:53:11 Luke Lindsay 
   o Moving trains: the class ServerGameEngine
   has a list of TrainMover objects, which control the 
   movement of individual trains.  Movement is triggered
   by calls to ServerGameEngine.update() in the GameLoop's
   run() method.   
03-Nov-2002 22:35:52 Luke Lindsay 
   o Improvements to TrainPosition and ChangeTrainPositionMove classes
28-Oct-2002 23:52:39 Luke Lindsay 
   o Fix javadoc warnings
   o Add 'upload to sourceforge' task to build.xml
   o Add world_javadoc task to build xml.
27-Oct-2002 21:54:46 Luke Lindsay 
   oWrote ChangeTrainPositionMove and ChangeTrainPositionTest
27-Oct-2002 01:09:22 Luke Lindsay 
   oWrote TrainPosition and TrainPositionTest to replace Snake class.
16-Oct-2002 22:58:03 Luke Lindsay 
   o Removed cyclic dependencies from the rest of
   the project.
16-Oct-2002 21:48:24 Luke Lindsay 
   o Refactored the jfreerails.world.* packages
   	so that (1) jfreerails.world.* do not depend on any
   				other jfreerails packages.
   			(2) there are no cyclic dependencies between
   				any of the jfreerails.world.* packages.
   	hopefully this should make it easier to maintain.
13-Oct-2002 22:30:30 Luke Lindsay 
   o Added trains!  They don't move yet.  Hit F7 when the cursor 
   is over the track to build one.
13-Oct-2002 00:24:18 Luke Lindsay <lindsal49@hotmail.com>:
	o Add a task to build.xml that runs all junit tests.

    files from a jar archive.

23-Sep-2002 23:35:30 Luke Lindsay <lindsal49@hotmail.com>:

    and PathWalker to move trains along a track.  To see it in action, run: 
    experimental.RunTrainDemo

    o wrote PathWalkerImpl and PathWalkerImplTest
19-Sep-2002 00:03:59 Luke Lindsay <lindsal49@hotmail.com>:
    o wrote SimplePathIteratorImpl and SimplePathIteratorImplTest
    o removed the method: 
    boolean canStepForward(int distance) 
    from the interface PathWalker so that looking ahead is not required.
16-Sep-2002 21:37:46 Luke Lindsay <lindsal49@hotmail.com>:
	o build.xml written by JonLS added.  (Sorry, I 
	forgot to add it to the change log earlier.)
