--- 
Hiermit möchte ich mein Beileid und meine Trauer bekunden für alle Menschen die durch
den gestrigen Terroranschlag leiden. Für so eine unverfrorene Sache fehlen jegliche Worte.

Ich wünsche mir, das die Linux und OpenSource Gemeinde weltweit zusammen hält und für
seine Freiheit kämpft. Auch hoffe ich, dass auch alle anderen Menschen aller Nationen für
ihre Freiheit und Demokratie kämpfen. Besonders die Staatsmänner und -führer, als Vertreter
ihrer Nation, sollten sich mehr Kommunikativ und Konstruktiv vereinen um Weltweit gegen
Terror vorzugehen.

In Trauer
Alexander Opitz
