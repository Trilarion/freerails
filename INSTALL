Install
=======

There is no installation routine at the moment!

Do the following:
- "sh ./autogen.sh" to generate the automatic build scripts

- "./configure" for using the Qt GUI
or
- "./configure --with-paragui-client" for using the paragui GUI

- "make" to compile all

- "src/main/freerails" to start the game (if configure and make was successfully :-)
