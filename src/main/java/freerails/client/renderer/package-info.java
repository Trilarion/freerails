/**
 * Provides classes that render/paint/draw the games graphics. Classes in this package
 * should be independent of the windowing toolkit being used. For example, they should
 * not import any <code>javax.swing.*</code> classes or any classes in the <code>
 * java.awt.Component hierarchy</code>. They may however import <code>java.awt</code>
 * classes needed to do drawing, e.g. <code>java.awt.Graphics</code> and <code>java.awt.Image</code>.
