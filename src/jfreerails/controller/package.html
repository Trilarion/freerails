Provides classes that may be used by the client or the server to operate on the 
game world, for example, building trains and stations. The classes in this package 
do not make changes to the game world directly, instead, changes are encapsulated 
in objects referred to as <em>moves</em>. See the package <a href="jfreerails/move/package-summary.html">jfreerails.move</a> 
for more details.
