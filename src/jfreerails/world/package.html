<p>The <code>jfreerails&#46world&#46*</code> packages provide the classes that make up 
  the game-world, the classes in these packages will be used by the client and 
  the server. If at some stage there is a C/C++ version of freerails that works 
  with the java version, then there will need to be C/C++ and java versions of 
  these classes. </p>
<p><strong>Properties of the classes</strong></p>
<p>(1) The classes need to be serializable so that the game state can be sent 
  over a network from the server to the client when the game starts and so that 
  game states can be loaded and saved to disk. To achieve this, they should implement 
  <code>jfreerails.world.common.FreerailsSerializable.</code></p>
<p>(2) The classes should override the equals method to test for logical equality. 
  (Two objects are logical equal if their fields have the same values.) Logical 
  equality should survive serialization: i.e. if object A is serialized and then 
  deserialized as B, then A.equals(B) should return true. The rationale for this 
  is it makes writing tests that compare actual and expected states of objects 
  easy.</p>
<p>(3) The dependencies between classes that make up the gameworld (those in <code>jfreerails.world.*</code> 
  packages ) should only flow in one direction. Eg, the World object has references, 
  either directly or indirectly, to all the objects that make up the gameworld, 
  so non of the other objects that make up the game world should have references 
  to the world object. Problems where it seems like, say, a station needs a reference 
  to the world object can be solved by adding a third object that is not itself 
  part of the gameworld but has a reference to the world and loops over the stations 
  or whatever and performs the necessary task.</p>
<p>(4) There should only be one chain of references leading from the world object 
  to each object in the gameworld. E.g. since the world object has a direct reference 
  to each of the stations, other objects in the gameworld should refer to stations 
  indirectly by storing a station number rather than a reference to a station 
  object.</p>
<p>(5) Changes to gameworld objects should be done using Move objects. There are 
  more details on the <a href="../move/package-summary.html">move package overview</a>.</p>
<p>(6) Where possible, gameworld elements should be immutable or composed of immmutable 
  parts. See Bloch, <em>Effective Java</em>, item 13 or <a href="http://courses.dce.harvard.edu/%7Ecscie160/EffectiveJava.htm" target="_blank">this
