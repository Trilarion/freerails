/**
 * This interface identifies a principal. This interface may be extended in
 * the future in order to provide faster lookups, rather than using name
 * comparisons.
 *
 * A principal represents an entity which can view or alter the game world. A
 * principal usually corresponds to a player's identity, but may also
 * represent an authorititative server, or a another game entity such as a
 * corporation. All entities which may own game world objects must be
 * represented by a principal.
