<p>Provides classes that encapsulate changes to the game world. The classes implement 
  the GoF command pattern, and they are referred to as 'moves'. They implement 
  the following interface:</p>

<pre><code><font size="2">public interface Move {

	MoveStatus tryDoMove(World w);

	MoveStatus tryUndoMove(World w);

	MoveStatus doMove(World w);

	MoveStatus undoMove(World w);

}
</font></code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have the following properties:</p>
<p>(1) The changes they encapsulate are stored in an address space independent 
  way, so that a move generated on a client can be serialised, sent over a network, 
  and then deserialised and executed on a server. To achieve this, they refer 
  to items in the game world via either their coorinates, e.g. tile 10,50, or 
  their position in a list, e.g. train #4.</p>
<p>(2) They are undoable. To achieve this, they need to store the information 
  necessary to undo the change. E.g. a change-terrain-type move might store the 
  tile coorindates, the terrain type before the change and the terrain type after 
  the change.</p>
<p>(3) The <code><font size="2">tryDoMove</font></code> and <code><font size="2">tryUndoMove</font></code> 
  methods test whether the move is valid but leave the gameworld unchanged.</p>
