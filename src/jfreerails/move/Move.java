/**
 * All moves should implement this interface and obey the contract
 * described below.
 * <p>(1) They should be immutable.</P>
 * <p>(2) They should overide <code>Object.equals()</code> to test
 * for logical equality.</P>
 * <p>(3) They should store 'before' and 'after' values for
 * all properties of the world object that the move changes.
 * <p>(4) The changes they encapsulate are stored in an address space
 * independent way, so that a move generated on a client can be serialised,
 * sent over a network, and then deserialised and executed on a server. To
 * achieve this, they refer to items in the game world via either their
 *  coorinates, e.g. tile 10,50, or their position in a list, e.g. train #4.</p>
 * <p>(5) They are undoable. To achieve this, they need to store the information
 * necessary to undo the change. E.g. a change-terrain-type move might store the
 * tile coorindates, the terrain type before the change and the terrain type
 *  after the change.</p>
 *<p>(6) The tryDoMove and tryUndoMove methods test whether the move is valid
 * but leave the gameworld unchanged</p>
