<p><strong>Brief overview of the architecture</strong></p>
<p>(1) The model and the view are separated. The classes that make up the model, 
  referred to as the <em>game world</em>, are in the jfreerails.world.* packages. 
  The view classes are in the jfreerails.client.* packages. </p>
<p>(2) All changes to the game world that occur after the game has started, referred 
  to as <em>moves</em>, are done using the classes in the package <a href="jfreerails/move/package-summary.html">jfreerails.move</a> 
  There are more details <a href="jfreerails/move/package-summary.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>(3) The client and server are separate. The game works as follows. When the 
  game starts or a game is loaded, the server sends the client a copy of the game 
  world. When the player does something, e.g. build track, the client sends a 
  move to the server. The server validates the move and updates its copy of the 
  game world, then sends the move back to the client (and to the clients belonging 
  to any other players). The clients then, and only then, update their copies 
  of the game world. Moves that are not caused by the player doing something, 
  e.g. new cargo being generated at stations, are generated by the server.</p>
<p><strong>Dependencies between packages</strong></p>
<p> To keep the code managable, there are rules governing which packages each 
  package may import classes from. The details are <a href="docs/dependencies.html">here</a>.</p>
