This is the source code for Railz, an open-source railroad RTS.
<ol>
<li>There are 3 main components:
<ul><li>A server component, which is responsible for maintaining a coherent model of the game world. The server-specific components are contained in the org.railz.server package.</li>
<li>A client component, which is responsible for providing the user interface to players in the game. The client maintains its own copy of the world model which is synchronized via moves passed between the client and the server. The client-specific components are maintained in the org.railz.client packages.</li>
<li>A launcher component, which is responsible for providing a graphical interface by which the server and/or client can be started, specifying appropriate options with which to initialise them. This is stored in org.railz.launcher</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All changes to the game world that occur after the game has started, referred to as <em>moves</em>, are done using the classes in the package <a href="org/railz/move/package-summary.html">org.railz.move</a> 
  There are more details <a href="org.railz/move/package-summary.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>The org.railz.util package contains utility classes which may be used by either the client or the server and are meant to be of a general-purpose nature.</li>
<li>The org.railz.controller package contains classes which are used by both the client and the server, and are (mostly) connected with communication between the client and server. <i>This package could probably do with a tidy-up at some point</i></li>
<li>The org.railz.world package contains classes which represent objects which make up the game-world and as such are shared alike by both the client and server components</li>
<li>The org.railz.data package contains data files (xml configuration files and l10n property files). <i>This should be moved at some point into the respective client and server packages</i></li>
</ol>
<h2>Future directions</h2>
<p>At some point in the future there may be other clients planned for the game. A 3D version of the client could be a possibility. With a view to this the intention is to evolve the current client architecture in a direction which would separate the main map from the rest of the user interface, with the 3D client using a separate 3D component for the main map area but sharing most of the rest of the UI.</p>
<p>Another client needed is a computer-controlled AI client, which would probably be written separately from the current client. These new clients will be constructed in new packages.</p>
<p>A further development envisaged is a command-line launcher with remote control interface which would enable the Railz server to be launched on a headless server.</p>
