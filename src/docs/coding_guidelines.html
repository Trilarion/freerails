<p><strong>Coding Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>(1) Run all unit tests after making changes to see whether anything has broken. 
  You can do this using the <strong>runtests </strong><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> 
  target.</p>
<p>(2) Consider writing <a href="http://www.junit.org">junit</a> tests.</p>
<p>(3) Consider using <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/assert.html">assertions</a>.</p>
<p>(4) Avoid circular dependencies between packages. I.e. if any classes in package 
  A import classes from package B, then classes in package B should not import 
  classes from package A. Also avoid unnecessary circular dependencies between 
  classes.</p>
<p>(5) Follow the <a href="dependencies.html">package dependency rules</a>. The 
  <strong>checkdep</strong> ant script tests compliance. To run it type: <code>ant 
  -f checkdep.xml </code> The script and the html page are generated by the class 
  <code>experimental.GenerateDependenciesXmlAndHtml</code>.</p>
<p>(6) Check the <strong>javadoc</strong> Ant target runs without errors or warnings.</p>
<p>(7) Javadoc comments. Add a couple of sentences saying what the class does 
  and the reason for its addition with a date. Also use the @author tag if you 
  add a new class or make a significant change to an existing one.</p>
<p>(8) Some of the GUI classes have been created using the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> 
  GUI editor. The .java files for these classes have corresponding .form files. 
  Within the java files are protected sections of code, if you edit these files, 
  please do not alter these sections by hand.</p>
<p>(9) Use Code Formatters with care. Avoid reformatting whole files with different 
  formatting schemes when you have only changed a few lines. There is an target 
  to format the code. It uses <a href="http://jalopy.sourceforge.net/">Jalopy</a>. 
  Note, the GUI classes created with the NetBeans GUI editor are excluded from 
  this format target. This is because Jalopy breaks the protected regions. These 
  files can be formatted using the default formatting scheme in NetBeans.</p>
<p><strong>Submitting Patches</strong></p>
<p>(1) Run CVS diff with output in 'unified' format. (You can do this in Eclipse 
  by selecting <em>Team -&gt; Create Patch</em>.)</p>
<p>(2) Give the patch a meaningful filename.</p>
<p>(3) Add them to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&group_id=9495&atid=309495">patch tracker</a> on the freerails sourceforge 
  page.</p>
<p>(4) Small patches that fix one thing, add one feature, or clean up one aspect 
  of the code are generally the easiest to manage.</p>
