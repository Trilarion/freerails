<p><strong>Coding Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>(1) Run all the unit tests after making changes to see whether anything has 
  broken. You can do this using the <strong>runtests </strong>Ant target.</p>
<p>(2) Write junit tests where in your judgement they would be appropriate.</p>
<p>(3) Ensure that there are no circular dependencies between packages. I.e. if 
  any classes in package A import classes from package B, then classes in package 
  B should not import classes from package A. You can use the <strong>checkdep</strong> 
  Ant target to help with this.</p>
<p>(4) Check that the <strong>javadoc</strong> Ant target runs without errors 
  or warnings.</p>
<p>(5) Javadoc comments. Add a couple of sentences saying what the class does 
  and the reason for its addition with a date. Also use the @author tag if you 
  add a new class or make a significant change to an existing one.</p>
