<p><strong>Coding Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>(1) Run all the unit tests after making changes to see whether anything has 
  broken. You can do this using the <strong>runtests </strong>Ant target.</p>
<p>(2) Write junit tests where in your judgement they would be appropriate.</p>
<p>(3) Ensure that there are no circular dependencies between packages. I.e. if 
  any classes in package A import classes from package B, then classes in package 
  B should not import classes from package A. You can use the <strong>checkdep</strong> 
  Ant target to help with this.</p>
<p>(4) Check that the <strong>javadoc</strong> Ant target runs without errors 
  or warnings.</p>
<p>(5) Javadoc comments. Add a couple of sentences saying what the class does 
  and the reason for its addition with a date. Also use the @author tag if you 
  add a new class or make a significant change to an existing one.</p>
<p>(6) Use Code Formatters with care. Try to avoid reformatting the whole file 
  with a different formatting scheme when you have only changed a few lines.</p>
<p><strong>Submitting Patches</strong></p>
<p>(1) Run CVS diff with output in 'unified' format.</p>
<p>(2) Send them to the mailing list: freerails-list@lists.sourceforge.net</p>
<p>(3) Small patches that fix one thing, add one feature, or clean up one aspect 
  of the code are generally the easiest to manage.</p>
