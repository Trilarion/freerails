<H2>Game Model</H2>
<H4>Time</H4>
<P>Each year is a representative day. So, for instance, a train
travelling at an average speed of 10 mph will make two (and a bit)
200 mile trips in a year.</P>
<H4>Map</H4>
<P>Two maps will be available. A map of south America - used for proper games 
  -and a small map - used for a tutorial. The maps are divided into square tiles. 
  Tiles are 10 miles across. Rather than let the scale vary between maps of different 
  sized regions, different sized maps should be used.</P>
<P class="planned">The exact shape of mountain ranges and the distribution of terrain
types will vary between games.</P>

<H4 class="planned">Terrain Heights</H4>
<P class="planned">Different terrain types will have different heights, I'll call 
  this the type-height. The height of a tile will be the weighted average of the 
  type-heights of the surrounding tiles.</P>
<H4>Cargo</H4>
<P>There are a number of cargo types, e.g. Mail, Passengers,
Livestock etc. Cargo types fall into one of the following categories:
Mail, Passengers, Fast Freight, Slow Freight, Bulk Freight. Mail is
the most sensitive to speed of delivery; Bulk Freight is the least. 
</P>
<H4>Cities</H4>
<P>Cities of random size are added at predefined locations on the map when the 
  game starts.<span class="planned"> As time passes, cities grow and shrink depending 
  the amount of cargo picked up and delivered.</span></P>
<H4>Track</H4>
<P>There are a number of track types, e.g. standard track, double
track, tunnel etc. A tile can only have track of one type.</P>
<P>You can only built track if you have cash &gt; 0. The cost of
building track depends on the track type, the track configuration,
and the right of way cost of the terrain. Some track types can only
be built on certain terrain, e.g. an Iron Girder bridge can only be
built on river. If some track has already been built, all new track
must connect to the existing track.</P>
<P>Track can be upgraded. The cost of upgrading track from type X to
type Y is less than the cost of building track of type Y but more
than the cost of Y less the cost of X.</P>
<P>Track can be removed. When you remove track you get some money
back.</P>
<P>Different track types have different maintenance costs. The
maintenance cost must be paid once per year.</P>
<H4>Trains</H4>
<P>Once you have built some track and a station you can build a
train. You get a choice of engines and the option to add up to 6
wagons. You can build trains even if you have cash &lt; 0. (This is
to stop people getting stuck without any trains since you need trains
to make money.)</P>
<P>Trains can be scheduled to stop at 2 or more stations.</P>
<H4>Engines</H4>
<P>Two types of engine are available when you start the game. <span class="planned">Three 
  other types become available later.</span></P>
<P class="planned">A train's engine can be upgraded.</P>
<H4>Wagons</H4>
<P>There is one wagon type for each cargo type. A wagon can carry 40
units of cargo. Wagons are free and can be added at any station
(since moving emtpy wagons about would be boring).</P>
<H4>Train Schedules</H4>
<P>The stations a train stops at and whether it changes its wagons
when it stops are governed by a train's schedule.</P>
<H4>Train movement</H4>
<P>The more wagons a train is pulling, the slower it moves.<span class="planned"> 
  The greater the amount of cargo, the slower the train. The gradient of the track 
  also affects speed.</span> When trains arrive at a station it stops for a few 
  moments to load and unload cargo. Trains stop instantly (this is a simplication 
  so we don't need to look ahead)<span class="planned"> but speed up slowly.</span></P>
<H4>Stations</H4>
<P>Supply and demand at a station is determined by the tile types within the station's 
  sphere-of-influence. Different station types have different sized spheres-of-influence. 
  The spheres-of-influence of two stations cannot overlap.</P>
<H4 class="planned">The Economy </H4>
<P class="planned">The economy alternates between 5 states.</P>
