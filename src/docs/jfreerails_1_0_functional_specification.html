<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>FreeRails a is real time multi player strategy game where players
compete to build the most powerful railroad empire. 
</P>
<P>This spec is incomplete and what is here will be revised several
times before it is finalized.</P>
<P>This spec does not discuss in detail how features will be
implemented.</P>
<H2>Scenarios</H2>
<P>In designing software, it helps to imagine a few real life stories
of how actual (stereotypical) people would use it. We'll look at
three scenarios.</P>
<H4>Scenario 1: Jeff.</H4>
<P>Aged 38, splits his time between contract web development work and
(real) surfing (i.e. He's an aging hippy). Played RT1, disliked RT2
and RT3. Skeptical about the quality of OS software.</P>
<H4>Scenario 2: Andy.</H4>
<P>Young programmer, 19, rides a moped. First language not English.
Never played RT1 but has played RT2 and RT3. When software doesn't
work or works in a way he doesn't expect, he is quick to blame the
software. Wants to get involved in the development of jfreerails and
to write is own AI.</P>
<H4>Scenario 3: Claudia.</H4>
<P>Smartest of the three. Recently left university and started
working for the government (as an economist). Never played any of the
RT games before. Wants something to play on her computer to distract
her from her research.</P>
<H2>Non Goals</H2>
<P>Realism - its a game not a simulation..</P>
<H2>Postponed for later releases</H2>
<P>This version will <I>not</I> support the following:</P>
<P>Customisablity</P>
<P>Difficulty levels</P>
<P>Advanced graphics (including animations other than movement).</P>
<P>Performance</P>
<P>Cheat proof: don't play it with your house-mate who keeps stealing
your milk</P>
<P>Prority Shipments</P>
<P>Scripting events and AI using Jython</P>
<P>Internet high score table</P>
<P>Custom Look-and-Feel</P>
<P>Undo building track.</P>
