<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>JFreerails 1.0 
</H1>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Functional Specification</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Luke Lindsay</P>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>FreeRails is real time multi player strategy game where players
compete to build the most powerful railroad empire. 
</P>
<P>This spec is incomplete and what is here will be revised several
times before it is finalized.</P>
<P>This spec does not discuss in detail how features will be
implemented.</P>
<H2>Scenarios</H2>
<P>In designing software, it helps to imagine a few real life stories
of how actual (stereotypical) people would use it. We'll look at
three scenarios.</P>
<H4>Scenario 1: Jeff.</H4>
<P>Aged  38, splits his time between contract web development work
and (real) surfing (i.e. He's an aging hippy).  Playered RT1,
disliked RT2 and RT3. Sceptical about the quality of OS software.</P>
<H4>Scenario 2: Andy.</H4>
<P>Young programmer, 19, rides a moped.  First language not English. 
Never played RT1 but has played RT2 and RT3.  When software doesn't
work or works in a way he doesn't expect, he is quick to blame the
software. Wants to get involved in the development of jfreerails and
to write is own AI.</P>
<H4>Scenario 3: Claudia.</H4>
<P>Smartest of the three.  Recently left university and started
working for the government (as an economist).  Never played any of
the RT games before.  Wants something to play on her computer to
distract her from her research.</P>
<H2>Non Goals</H2>
<P>This version will <I>not</I> support the following:</P>
<P>Realism &ndash; its a game not a simulation..</P>
<P>Customisablity</P>
<P>Advanced graphics: 
</P>
<P>Performance</P>
<P>Cheat proof: don't play it with your house-mate who keeps stealing
your milk</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2>Game Model</H2>
<H4>Map</H4>
<P>Two maps will be available. A map of south america &ndash; used
for proper games &ndash; and a small map &ndash; used for the
tutorial.  The maps are divided into square tiles.</P>
