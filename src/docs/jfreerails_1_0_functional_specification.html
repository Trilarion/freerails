<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>JFreerails 1.0 
</H1>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Functional Specification</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Luke Lindsay</P>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>FreeRails a is real time multi player strategy game where players
compete to build the most powerful railroad empire. 
</P>
<P>This spec is incomplete and what is here will be revised several
times before it is finalized.</P>
<P>This spec does not discuss in detail how features will be
implemented.</P>
<H2>Scenarios</H2>
<P>In designing software, it helps to imagine a few real life stories
of how actual (stereotypical) people would use it. We'll look at
three scenarios.</P>
<H4>Scenario 1: Jeff.</H4>
<P>Aged 38, splits his time between contract web development work and
(real) surfing (i.e. He's an aging hippy). Played RT1, disliked RT2
and RT3. Skeptical about the quality of OS software.</P>
<H4>Scenario 2: Andy.</H4>
<P>Young programmer, 19, rides a moped. First language not English.
Never played RT1 but has played RT2 and RT3. When software doesn't
work or works in a way he doesn't expect, he is quick to blame the
software. Wants to get involved in the development of jfreerails and
to write is own AI.</P>
<H4>Scenario 3: Claudia.</H4>
<P>Smartest of the three. Recently left university and started
working for the government (as an economist). Never played any of the
RT games before. Wants something to play on her computer to distract
her from her research.</P>
<H2>Non Goals</H2>
<P>This version will <I>not</I> support the following:</P>
<P>Realism &ndash; its a game not a simulation..</P>
<P>Customisablity</P>
<P>Advanced graphics: 
</P>
<P>Performance</P>
<P>Cheat proof: don't play it with your house-mate who keeps stealing
your milk</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2>Game Model</H2>
<H4>Map</H4>
<P>Two maps will be available. A map of south America &ndash; used
for proper games &ndash; and a small map &ndash; used for a tutorial.
The maps are divided into square tiles.</P>

</P>
<H4>Cargo</H4>
<P>There are a number of cargo types, e.g. Mail, Passengers,
Livestock etc. Cargo types fall into one of the following categories:
Mail, Passengers, Fast Freight, Slow Freight, Bulk Freight. Mail is
the most sensitive to speed of delivery; Bulk Freight is the least. 
</P>
<H4>Cities</H4>
<P>Cities of random size are added at predefined locations on the map
when the game starts. As time passes, cities grow and shrink
depending the amount of cargo picked up and delivered.</P>
<H4>Track</H4>
<P>There are a number of track types, e.g. standard track, double
track, tunnel etc. A tile can only have track of one type.</P>
<P>You can only built track if you have cash &gt; 0. The cost of
building track depends on the track type, the track configuration,
and the right of way cost of the terrain. Some track types can only
be built on certain terrain, e.g. an Iron Girder bridge can only be
built on river. If some track has already been built, all new track
must connect to the existing track.</P>
<P>Track can be upgraded. The cost of upgrading track from type X to
type Y is less than the cost of building track of type Y but more
than the cost of Y less the cost of X.</P>
<P>Track can be removed. When you remove track you get some money
back.</P>
<P>Different track types have different maintenance costs. The
maintenance cost must be paid once per year.</P>
<H4>Trains</H4>
<P>Once you have built some track and a station you can build a
train. You get a choice of engines and the option to add up to 6
wagons. You can build trains even if you have cash &lt; 0. (This is
to stop people getting stuck without any trains since you need trains
to make money.)</P>
<P>Trains can be scheduled to stop at 2 or more stations.</P>
<H4>Engines</H4>
<P>Types of engine are available when you start the game, three other
types become available later.</P>
<P>A trains engine can be upgraded.</P>
<H4>Wagons</H4>
<P>There is one wagon type for each cargo type. A wagon can carry 40
units of cargo. Wagons are free and can be added at any station.</P>
<H4>Train Schedules</H4>
<P>The stations a train stops at and whether it changes its wagons
when it stops are governed by a train's schedule.</P>
<H4>Train movement</H4>
<P>The more wagons a train is pulling, the slower it moves. The
gradient of the track also affects speed. When trains arrive at a
station it stops for a few moments to load and unload cargo.</P>
<H4>Stations</H4>
<P>Supply and demand at a station is determined by the tile types
withing the station's sphere-of-influence. Different station types
have different sized spheres-of-influence. The spheres-of-influence
of two stations cannot overlap.</P>
<H2>User Interface</H2>

<H4>Cursor</H4>
<P>The cursor can be in one of the following modes.</P>
<H4>Place station mode</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The cursor gets put into place-station-mode when the player
	selects a station type from the build tab.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Shows the radius of the selected station type.</P>
	<LI><P>Red when station cannot be built on selected square, white
	otherwise.  This should be determined by whether building the
	station is possible, not merely whether there is track on the
	selected tile.</P>
	<LI><P>Pressing the LMB attempts to place the station.  If the
	station is built, the cursor is returned to its previous mode; if
	the station is not built, the cursor remains in place-station-mode.</P>
	<LI><P>Pressing the RMB or pressing Esc cancels placing the station
	and returns the cursor to its previous mode.</P>
