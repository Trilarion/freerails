FreeRails a is real time multi player strategy game where players compete to build the most powerful railroad empire.

*Scenarios*

In designing software, it helps to imagine a few real life stories of how actual (stereotypical) people would use it. We'll look at three scenarios.

Scenario 1: Jeff.
Aged 38, splits his time between contract web development work and (real) surfing (i.e. He's an aging hippy). Played RT1, disliked RT2 and RT3. Sceptical about the quality of open source software.

Scenario 2: Andy.
Young programmer, 19, rides a moped. First language not English. Never played RT1 but has played RT2 and RT3. When software doesn't work or works in a way he doesn't expect, he is quick to blame the software. Wants to get involved in the development of jfreerails and to write is own AI.

Scenario 3: Claudia.
Recently left university and started working for the government (as an economist). Never played any of the RT games before. Wants something to play on her computer to distract her from her research.


*Non Goals*

Realism - it's a game not a simulation.
