   it it will refresh even if the moves are generate by another 
   player.
08-Nov-2002 23:05:39 Luke Lindsay 
   o Stations can be built by pressing F8.
   o The station types no longer appear with the track
   types on the build menu.

   oFixed 'jar_doc' task in build.xml
05-Nov-2002 22:53:11 Luke Lindsay 
   o Moving trains: the class ServerGameEngine
   has a list of TrainMover objects, which control the 
   movement of individual trains.  Movement is triggered
   by calls to ServerGameEngine.update() in the GameLoop's
   run() method.

   			(2) there are no cyclic dependencies between
   				any of the freerails.world.* packages.
   	hopefully this should make it easier to maintain.
