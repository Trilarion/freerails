<h3>Brief overview of the architecture</h3>
<ol>
  <li> The model and the view are separated. The classes that make up the model, 
    referred to as the <em>game world</em>, are in the <code>jfreerails.world.*</code> 
    packages. The view classes are in the <code>jfreerails.client.*</code> packages. 
  </li>
  <li> The state of game world is stored by an instance of a class implementing 
    the interface <a href="freerails/world/top/World.html"><code>World</code></a>.
    This class is mutable - one can think of it as a specialised hashmap. All 
    the objects that represent entities in the world - values in the hashmap - 
    are immutable. It follows that changes to the gameworld involve adding, removing or replacing 
    objects representing entities rather than changing their properties. </li>
  <li> The client and server are separate. They communciate by sending objects 
    to each other. This is done either by placing objects on a queue or by sending 
    serialized objects over a network connection. All objects passed between the 
    client and server are immutable and are instances of one of the following: 
    <ul>
      <li><a href="freerails/controller/Message2Server.html"><code>Message2Server</code></a></li>
      <li><code><a href="freerails/controller/Message2Client.html">Message2Client</a></code></li>
      <li><code><a href="freerails/controller/MessageStatus.html">MessageStatus</a></code></li>
      <li><code><a href="freerails/controller/PreMove.html">PreMove</a></code></li>
	  <li><code><a href="freerails/controller/PreMoveStatus.html">PreMoveStatus</a></code></li>
      <li><code><a href="freerails/move/Move.html">Move</a></code></li>
	  <li><code><a href="freerails/move/MoveStatus.html">MoveStatus</a></code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> When a new game starts or a game is loaded, the server sends the client 
    a copy of the World object (using an instance of <a href="freerails/network/SetWorldMessage2Client.html"><code>SetWorldMessage2Client</code></a>)
    All changes to the game world that occur after the game has started, referred 
    to as <em>moves</em>, are done using the classes in the package <a href="freerails/move/package-summary.html"><code>jfreerails.move</code></a>.
    Moves are either obtained from a PreMove object or constructed directly. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Dependencies between packages</h3>
<p> To keep the code managable, there are rules governing which packages each 
  package may import classes from. The details are <a href="docs/dependencies.html">here</a>.</p>
