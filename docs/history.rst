FreeRails (2000-2005)
---------------------

The original `FreeRails <https://sourceforge.net/projects/freerails/>`__
project was registered on Sourceforge on 2000-08-09 with the aim to
create a fun game based off the RailRoad Tycoon and RailRoad Tycoon II
games. It was described as a real time multi player strategy game where
players compete to build the most powerful railroad empire.

The introductory `news
message <https://sourceforge.net/p/freerails/news/2000/08/freerails-sister-project-of-freeciv/>`__
by Luke Ehresman reads:

    My friends and I have long loved the game Railroad Tycoon, and would
    love to see a open source version, very similar to FreeCiv. However,
    none of us have time to work on this due to dedication to other open
    source projects. We would love to see people run with the idea, and
    in a hopeful attempt at pushing the idea off to the open source
    community, I have created a SourceForge project. To find out more
    about the FreeRails project (sister project to FreeCiv), visit the
    web page: http://freerails.sourceforge.net and be sure to join our
    mailing list as we discuss the future and feasibility of this
    project.

It was programmed in Java and used a `CVS
repository <http://freerails.cvs.sourceforge.net/>`__ for source
control. Regular
`releases <https://sourceforge.net/projects/freerails/files/jfreerails/>`__
from 2001-07-25 (version 0.0.2) to 2005-09-23 (version 0.2.7) brought it
to a quite extensive, playable tech demo including play over network.
The source code is under the GPL-2.0 license. Main Java programmer seems
to have been Luke Lindsay.

-  Last binary release: `FreeRails
   0.2.7 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/freerails/files/jfreerails/0.2.7/>`__

C++/C# client for FreeRails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A client for Freerails using C++ was
`announced <https://sourceforge.net/p/freerails/news/2001/08/freerails-status-update/>`__
in 2001-08, but no official releases remain. Code can be found in the
CVS repository. They shared the same graphics resources.

Railz (2004-2005)
-----------------

On 2004-02-23, Railz was registered on now defunct
`BerliOS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BerliOS>`__ as a railway
strategy/management game based upon the freerails source code base. It
was created by Robert Tuck. Until the beginning of 2005 it saw several
releases and the code was considerably changed from the FreeRails
project on Sourceforge. An archived version of the `project
page <https://web.archive.org/web/20140328214257/http://developer.berlios.de/projects/railz/>`__
is available as well as a automated `exported project
page <https://sourceforge.net/projects/railz.berlios/>`__. The source
code of Railz was also released under GPL-2.0.

-  Last binary release: `Railz
   0.3.3 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/railz.berlios/files/>`__
-  Authors: Those of FreeRails (2000-2005), especially Robert Tuck

FreeRails2 (2007-2008)
----------------------

On 2007-11-05,
`FreeRails2 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/freerails2>`__ was
registered on Sourceforge with the aim to create an optimized version of
the FreeRails project. A web start version was included on the `web
site <http://freerails2.sourceforge.net/>`__. It used a `SVN
repository <https://sourceforge.net/p/freerails2/code/HEAD/tree/>`__ to
extend the code base of the FreeRails (2000-2005) project. The
development mainly focused on improving the infrastructure. The main
contributor was Roland Spatzenegger.

-  Last binary release: `FreeRails2
   0.4.0 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/freerails2/files/freerails2/v0.4.0/>`__
-  Authors: Those of FreeRails (2000-2005) and Roland Spatzenegger
   (cymric_npg)

Railz2 (2012-2014)
------------------

On 2012-04-08, LukeYJ (Luke Jordan?) created the
`Railz2 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/railz2/>`__ project on
Sourceforge as a follow-on to the freerails and Railz projects. The code
was stored in a `SVN
repository <https://sourceforge.net/p/railz2/code/HEAD/tree/>`__ and the
starting point was the Railz 0.3.3 release. Again the Java code base was
extended.

-  Last binary release: `Railz2
   0.4.0 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/railz2/files/>`__
-  Authors: Those of Railz and LukeYJ

FreeRails3 (2016)
-----------------

On 2016-12-24, LukeYJ created the
`FreeRails3 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/freerails3/>`__ project on
Sourceforge as a fork from the inactive Freerails2 project. The code was
stored in a `GIT
repository <https://sourceforge.net/p/freerails3/code/ci/master/tree/>`__
and the history FreeRails2 was imported. Within a few weeks some issues
were fixed and a new release was made with the version number 0.0.4
(smaller than the version of FreeRails before). Finally the code was
also placed on `Github <https://github.com/lukeyj13/freerails3>`__.

-  Last binary release: `FreeRails3
   0.0.4 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/freerails3/files/release-0.0.4/>`__
-  Authors: Those of FreeRails2 and LukeYJ

FreeRails continuation (2017-)
------------------------------

On 2017-12-12, Trilarion created the
`FreeRails <https://github.com/Trilarion/freerails>`__ project on Github
as a continuation of FreeRails 1, 2 and 3 in Java. The history of
FreeRails 1, 2 and 3 as well as Railz 1 and 2 was investigated, stored
in git branches (`FreeRails on
Sourceforge <https://github.com/Trilarion/freerails/tree/freerails_sourceforge>`__
and `Railz on
Sourceforge <https://github.com/Trilarion/freerails/tree/railz_sourceforge>`__)
including the last releases of each of the previous projects.

No release has yet been made.
