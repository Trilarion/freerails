=========
IMPORTAND
=========

There are bugs in ParaGUI up to 1.0.4Beta1 ... if you want nice working
panels on right side, then use the ParaGUI 1.0.4Beta2 package.

See requirements.

COPYING file for full details.


Requirements
============

Cause of that we don't want to redefine the wheel we use libraries. You have
two possibilities for graphics.

For Linux, Win32, BeOS, MacOS(, *BSD ?)
1. you use SDL >= 1.2.0 (with SDL_ttf >= 2.0 and SDL_image >= 1.2) and ParaGUI >= 1.0.2
For Linux/X11, Win32, *BSD, OS/2(XFree86), several UNIX's
2. you use Qt >= 3.1.0



Where to get:

SDL:
    http://www.libsdl.org
SDL_ttf:
    http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf
SDL_image:
    http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image
ParaGUI:
    http://www.paragui.org
Qt:
    http://www.trolltech.com

Don't forget to take a look in the Licence of the libraries you use.


Compiling and installing:
=========================

If you have extracted fresh from CVS then you need at first to autogenerate the
configuration scripts. Do this by typing "sh ./autogen.sh".

Use the configure command to generate the makefiles with your configuration.
Try "./configure --help" to see all the options you can use.
By standard configuration the Qt libraries are choosen as ground graphic
library. With "./configure --with-paragui-client" you can choose the libSDL
with ParaGUI version.

Now type "make" in the directory where the README file is.
If you get errors feel free and write to the mailinglist or in the buglist on
http://sourceforge.net/projects/freerails .
There is no install possibilities at the moment.


Starting a new game:
====================

Start under your X11 environment with "./src/main/freerails" in the directory
where this README is.
If you using the paragui version you can specify the theme which can be use
as parameter or you can use "-f" for fullscreen view.


Playing the game:
=================

The down described possibilities are partly gone while porting from C to C++

Nothing realy to play yet. You can set stations and tracks and then build
trains and let them drive over the tracks. They don't stop at stations nor
have a logic.


And finally:
============

Have fun to help us in developing!
