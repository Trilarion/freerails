Welcome to FreeRails!

We are on porting the source from C to C++ so it can be, that you can't compile
the cvs.
Please do NOT mass us up with this problems!!! This can happen while porting.

Cause of that we don't want to redefine the wheel we use libraries. You have
two possibilities for graphics.

For Linux, Win32, BeOS, MacOS(, *BSD ?)
1. you use SDL >= 1.2.0 (with SDL_ttf >= 2.0 and SDL_image >= 1.2) and paraGUI >= 1.0.0
For Linux/X11, Win32, *BSD, OS/2(XFree86), several UNIX's
2. you use Qt >= 2.2.0 (We will switch to Qt 3.0.0 as soon as it's stable)



Where to get:

SDL:
    http://www.libsdl.org
SDL_ttf:
    http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf

Don't forget to take a look in the Licence of the libraries you use.


Compiling and installing:
=========================

Change the Rules.make file to what you want (SDL with paraGUI or Qt).
Only type make in the directory where the Rules.make is.
If you get errors feel free and write to the mailinglist or in the buglist on
http://sourceforge.net/projects/freerails .
There is no install possibilities at the moment.


Starting a new game:
====================

start under your X11 environment with "game" in the directory where the
Rules.make is.


Playing the game:
=================

Nothing realy to play yet. You can set stations and tracks and then build
trains and let them drive to an other station. (It must be a direct connection!)
See the last ChangeLog entries for more information about what does function.


And finally:
============

Have fun to help us in developing!
