Enabling logging
=============
Either type:
java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties jfreerails/launcher/Launcher
or
ant run

Make sure that 'logging.properties' is in the working directory.

A log file called something like 'JFreerailsLog0.txt' will be written in your home directory.

Windows users
=============
If you experience poor frame rates, try the following.
java -Dsun.java2d.d3d=false jfreerails/launcher/Launcher


Mac OS X users:
===============

There appears to be a bug in Mac OS X Java 1.4.2 which causes problems with map redraws. If this affects you then try running
java -DOSXWorkaround=true \
jfreerails/launcher/Launcher
