Getting it, either:

 	Check-out the jfreerails module from the CVS.
or
	Download a package from the sourceforge page.


Requires: 
JDK 1.4.2 or later, which can be downloaded from:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/

Webstart link:
http://freerails.sourceforge.net/jfreerails.jnlp

To run the binary distribution

	type: java -jar jFreeRails-@version@-bin.jar


To compile and run the source distribution:
(1) Extract the source files from the jar
	jar -xf jFreeRails-@version@-src.jar
(2)	To compile, either 
	(i) go to the directory src, and type: javac -source 1.4 jfreerails/launcher/Launcher.java
or	
 	(ii) use the build.xml file and Ant version 1.5.
(3)	To run, type: java jfreerails/launcher/Launcher
				
For more information, see:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/freerails/
or

N.B. The source package contains some unit tests.  To compile them you will
need to add junit.jar to your classpath, which can be downloaded from 
www.junit.org.

Enabling logging
=============
Either type:
java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties jfreerails/launcher/Launcher
or
ant run

Make sure that 'logging.properties' is in the working directory.

A log file called something like 'JFreerailsLog0.txt' will be written in your home directory.

Windows users
=============
If you experience poor frame rates, try the following.
java -Dsun.java2d.d3d=false jfreerails/launcher/Launcher


Mac OS X users:
===============

There appears to be a bug in Mac OS X Java 1.4.2 which causes problems with map redraws. If this affects you then try running
java -DOSXWorkaround=true \
jfreerails/launcher/Launcher
