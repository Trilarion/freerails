=================
FreeRails v0.0.7+
=================

Welcome to FreeRails!

=========
IMPORTAND
=========

We are on porting the source from C to C++ so it can be, that you can't compile
the cvs.
Please do NOT mass us up with this problems!!! This can happen while porting.

=========
IMPORTAND
=========

We using 2 different libraries to display.

1.) Qt 3.0.x
2.) libSDL 1.2.x with paraGUI 1.0.2

See requirements.


Web site:
=========

FreeRails web site is here:

  http://freerails.sourceforge.net/

We invite you to visit. You can get the latest FreeRails news, releases
and patches, find out about the FreeRails mailing lists.

you may copy this program (including source) freely, but see the
COPYING file for full details.


Requirements
============

Cause of that we don't want to redefine the wheel we use libraries. You have
two possibilities for graphics.

For Linux, Win32, BeOS, MacOS(, *BSD ?)
1. you use SDL >= 1.2.0 (with SDL_ttf >= 2.0 and SDL_image >= 1.2) and paraGUI >= 1.0.2
For Linux/X11, Win32, *BSD, OS/2(XFree86), several UNIX's
2. you use Qt >= 3.0.0 (We are on switching to Qt 3.0.0)



Where to get:

SDL:
    http://www.libsdl.org
SDL_ttf:
    http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf
SDL_image:
    http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image
paraGUI:
    http://www.paragui.org
Qt:
    http://www.trolltech.com

Don't forget to take a look in the Licence of the libraries you use.


Compiling and installing:
=========================

If you have extracted fresh from CVS then you need at first to autogenerate the
configuration scripts. Do this by typing "sh ./autogen.sh".

Use the configure command to generate the makefiles with your configuration.
Try "configure --help" to see all the options you can use.
By standard configuration the Qt libraries are choosen as ground graphic library.

Now type make in the directory where the README file is.
If you get errors feel free and write to the mailinglist or in the buglist on
http://sourceforge.net/projects/freerails .
There is no install possibilities at the moment.


Starting a new game:
====================

Start under your X11 environment with "./src/main/freerails" in the directory where this
README is.
If you using the paragui version you can specify the theme which can be use as parameter
or you can use "-f" for fullscreen view.


Playing the game:
=================

The down described possibilities are gone while porting from C to C++

Nothing realy to play yet. You can set stations and tracks and then build
trains and let them drive to an other station. (It must be a direct connection!)
See the last ChangeLog entries for more information about what does function.


And finally:
============

Have fun to help us in developing!
